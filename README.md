#Lyrics Game

Simple game where you choose the song a certain lyric 
is from. Allows user to select artist they want 
the songs to be from.

Project is started because I want to try writing some 
frontend stuff. Frontend is written in Javascript (using React), while 
backend is written in Python (using Flask).
